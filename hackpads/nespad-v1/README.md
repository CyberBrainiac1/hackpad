### Inspiration

Right off the bat I wanted to create a hackpad reminiscent of a retro game controller. This hackpad is similar to the NES controller, hence nespad, but the buttons are smushed together for space, and there is not start/select
There are some holes to show however that this isn't a gamecontroller, but a hackpad. I had fun designing this hackpad

### Challenges

My main challenge was learning to design the case, as I had no idea of what I was doing and if I was doing it right.
