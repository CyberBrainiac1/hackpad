I was inspired by myself, as i created the design along the way. This is the first PCB ive ever made, and am pround of it. One challenge i have overcome is my procrastination, which has pushed writing this readme and making the firmware to tthe deadline.
BOM:
1x EC11E Rotary encoder with switch
12x cherry mx switches (the ones linked in the guide)
12x 1N148 diodes
1x XIAO DIP SMD
