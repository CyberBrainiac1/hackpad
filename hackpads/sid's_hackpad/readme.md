# Sid's Hackpad
My hackpad has 11 switches to be the most useless modifier keys just because.   
I'll probably figure out how it best fits into my workflow as I use it.

# Key features:
* 11 MX switches
* Uh yeah thats it

# CAD/case:
There are just 4 screw holes which will use M5 bolts and heatset inserts at the bottom to hold the 2 pieces together.

# PCB:
The PCB uses a matrix to prevent ghosting on any of the 11 keys.

# Firmware:
I used KMK for the firmware. Currently, the firmware is just a bunch of modifier keys, but once I think more about what would be useful for me I will change it.
